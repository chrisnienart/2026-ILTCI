# Introduction

**Core Analogy: AI is this generation's computer**
- Everyone will need to know how to use it in their area of engagement

**Key Concept: AI has commoditized expertise**
- Costs (and revenue) are massively reduced

# Current State

**Development of new infrastructure**
- Innovation is happening in software

**Business world is waiting and flat footed**
- Innovation at the business level won't happen for years
- But when new innovations arrive, it will be a scramble

# General Pattern

1. Groundbreaking theoretical concept proven possible (Attention is All You Need, GPT-2)
2. Academic result becomes good enough in quality for experts, initial use cases (GPT-3)
3. Time to complete tasks reduced by several multiples (i.e 3x) leads to cost savings
4. Time to complete tasks reduced by orders of magnitude (i.e >10x) leads to new capabilities
5. Broadening of breadth leads to innovative ideas
6. Sufficiently many new ideas become successful to permanently influence products and services
7. New products and services become differentiated and specialized

# Specific Use Cases

- Show the RPEC tool
- Programmatic updates via Github Copilot in documents
- Programmatic updates for actuarial models

# Advice for Adoption

1. **Get a baseline:** watch videos on topics of interest, start with something easy for you
2. **Try something:** do tutorials on a topic of interest, recreate something that you are familiar with
3. **Do a project:** pick something of personal interest to you
4. **Create a real product or service:** quality exceeds current standards

*All of these steps will need to be repeated several times*

# Future Needs

**Adjust to the culture shock:** AI is the expert, not people

**Adjust to new skill sets:** you will do everything by managing AI

**Traditional skills for now:** learn to use an IDE, master version control
